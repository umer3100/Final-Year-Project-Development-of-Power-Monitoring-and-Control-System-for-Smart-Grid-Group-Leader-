Utilized IoT techniques to improve power grid reliability through a Power Monitoring and Control System for Smart Grid

Electric power systems are critical to modern society, providing the energy required for everything 
from lighting and heating to manufacturing and transportation. However, poor power quality can 
result in equipment damage, increased energy consumption, and reduced system efficiency. 
Therefore, the need for monitoring and analyzing the power quality of electrical smart grids has 
become increasingly important. A smart grid is an electricity network that uses digital and other 
advanced technologies to monitor and manage the transport of electricity from all generation 
sources to meet the varying electricity demands of end users.   

The purpose of this project is to develop a system for monitoring and analyzing the power quality 
of an electrical grid. The objectives of the project are to identify issues related to power quality 
such as harmonic distortion, power factor imbalances, and voltage fluctuations, and to implement 
corrective actions such as power factor correction or voltage regulation to improve power quality 
and reduce energy waste. The project will improve the reliability and efficiency of the electrical 
grid, leading to cost savings, reduced downtime, and increased customer satisfaction.  

This project will involve selecting appropriate sensors and measurement devices, collecting and 
processing data, identifying corrective actions, implementing those actions, and continuously 
monitoring the system to ensure that it is working effectively. The project will be conducted on a 
simulated electrical smart grid to test and evaluate the system before implementation on a real, 
world electrical grid. The results of the project will be useful to power utilities, system operators, 
and other stakeholders interested in improving the power quality of electrical grids.
